The repository of the first project of the minor

The goal of the project was to create a web app with a SPARQL database. Allthough the main focus of the project was ADAMNET, I chose to work with WikiData, simply because there is a lot more data, and I wanted to do something with sportspersons from Amsterdam. ADAMNET lacked data about sportspersons.

## The App
My idea was to give an overview of sportspersons and their accomplishments. A user should have been able to find a sportsperson based on the sport he or she practisised. Then you could search for a person. We had one week for this project, and the first two days I really struggled with SPARQL. Because of this, I didn't have enough time to finish my app. You can search for a sportsperson, but you can't see his or hers accomplishments.

## Wishlist
Of course, something I would have wanted to accomplish, is an overview of the accomplishments of the sportspersons, since this was the main goal of my web app. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time, but this sure is something that I would like to add to the web app.
Then, if I had more time, I would like to change the visualisation of the dataset. Now it is really gray and boring. It doesn't represent something about sports or accomplishments at all.
